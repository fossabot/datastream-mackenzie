* <p>The Mackenzie River Basin is a vast, beautiful and critical natural feature of Canada. Flowing North, it extends through three provinces and three territories connecting distant corners of the West before draining its waters into the Arctic Ocean. At 1.8 million sq. km, the Mackenzie plays a significant environmental, economic and spiritual role that stretches far beyond its borders.</p><p class="small"><strong>Length of Mainstem;&nbsp;</strong>1,802 km<span>&nbsp;•&nbsp;</span><strong>Average Discharge;&nbsp;</strong>9,700 m<sup>3</sup>/S<span>&nbsp;•&nbsp;</span><strong>Watershed Area;&nbsp;</strong>1.8 million km<sup>2</sup><span>&nbsp;•&nbsp;</span><strong>Major Drainage Basin;&nbsp;</strong>Arctic Ocean<span>&nbsp;•&nbsp;</span><strong>Jurisdiction;&nbsp;</strong>Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan<span>&nbsp;•&nbsp;</span><strong>Traditional Territories;&nbsp;</strong>Inuvialuit, Gwich’in, Sahtu, Dehcho, Tlicho, Weledeh, Chipewyan, Woodland Cree, Metis, Dane-zaa, Kaska, Sekani, Nakoda, Iroquois</p>

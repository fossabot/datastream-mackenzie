## About Communities

Mackenzie DataStream is a hub for sharing data collected in the Mackenzie River Basin. Communities play a critical role in collecting information used to help understand freshwater health and in decision-making. Currently, Mackenzie DataStream contains data collected by 21 communities who monitor 70+ parameters as part of the NWT-wide Community-Based Monitoring program, and one community in Northern B.C.
If you do not see your community listed, check back again soon or send us an e-mail at DataStream@gordonfn.org. We want to work together to make sure all communities within the Basin are represented.

## About DataStream

### Mackenzie DataStream

Mackenzie DataStream is an open access platform for sharing and exploring water data in the Mackenzie River Basin.  Our mission is to promote knowledge sharing and advance collaborative, evidence-based decision-making throughout the Basin.

### Principles

We are committed to principles of: ethically open access; data quality; interoperability, security and sustainability. To find out more about our data principles, see the <a href="http://mackenziedatastream.org/#/page/data-policy" target="_blank">Data Policy</a>.

###  Data
Mackenzie DataStream currently contains data collected by 22 <a href="http://mackenziedatastream.org/#/page/about-communities" target="_blank">communities</a> who monitor 70+ parameters and we are actively seeking <a href="http://mackenziedatastream.org/#/page/become-a-data-steward" target="_blank">partnerships</a> to bring new data contributors  onboard.
Data are currently collected by community monitors with the help of scientists and accredited laboratories, who look for dissolved metals, turbidity, temperature, chlorophyll-a, as well as oil and gas chemicals (hydrocarbons).  Equipment and methods used include: grab samples which are sent to laboratories to measure over 70 parameters; passive samplers (Polyethylene Membrane Devices and Diffusion Gradients in Thin Films); and YSI Sondes.

### Partners
<a href="http://gordonfoundation.ca/" target="_blank"> The Gordon Foundation</a> has made a longstanding commitment to protect Canada’s water and empower Canada’s North. The Mackenzie River Basin Initiative supports innovative research and communications to strengthen citizen engagement in freshwater management, and to drive the development of sound freshwater policy.
The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) in partnership with water partners throughout the Northwest Territories, the Mackenzie River Basin and beyond, leads the implementation of <a href="http://www.nwtwaterstewardship.ca/" target="_blank">The NWT Water Strategy</a>. The NWT Water Strategy, which was developed by territorial, federal and Aboriginal governments, environmental organisations, regulatory boards and other water partners is the guiding policy document for water management in the territory. Its implementation supports the vision that ‘waters of the NWT remain clean, abundant and productive for all time.'
Mackenzie DataStream would not be possible without the work and collaboration that our community partners have played in the day-to-day collection of the data.  These community members, as well as the scientists that helped them, are the real heroes of Mackenzie DataStream.  For a full list of the communities that have participated in the collection of data for Mackenzie DataStream see our
